**Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized the text, removed stopwords, and lemmatized the narratives.
**Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized product distribution, narrative lengths, and word clouds per category.
**Feature Engineering**: Used TF-IDF, GloVe embeddings, and Word2Vec for feature extraction.
**Modeling**: Tested multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, SVM) with TF-IDF features.
**Evaluation**: Reported classification performance using accuracy and classification reports.
